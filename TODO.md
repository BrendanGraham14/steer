- [x] Platform detection
- [x] Directory structure scanning

## Current Progress (March 2025)

### Critical Compilation Errors (Priority 1)
- [x] Create utils module referenced in main.rs
- [x] Fix stream handling in API client and TUI module
- [x] Add proper StreamExt import in TUI module
- [x] Fix string formatting in message_formatter.rs
- [x] Fix type mismatch in conversation.rs message handling
- [x] Implement missing tool_calls functionality in TUI module
- [x] Fix potential deadlock in conversation.compact method

### Additional Compilation Errors (Priority 2)
- [x] Make API submodules (messages and tools) public
- [x] Fix module imports and re-exports
- [x] Fix ratatui Frame generic parameters
- [x] Fix regex escaping issues in the tool handler
- [x] Fix pattern matching in input handling
- [x] Fix Paragraph::new usage with proper type annotations
- [x] Fix regex unwrap_or_default usage (Regex doesn't implement Default)
- [x] Resolve the borrowed data escaping issue in bash.rs
- [x] Fix access to private fields in the App struct
- [x] Fix method usage on the App struct
- [x] Fix the env attribute in clap arg declarations

### Next Steps (March 2025)

#### Priority 1: Architecture Improvements
- [x] Refactor architecture following the design in ARCHITECTURE.md:
  - [x] Create proper ToolExecutor in App layer
  - [x] Update API client to only communicate with App layer, not TUI
  - [x] Move all API calls from TUI to App layer
  - [x] Simplify TUI to only handle display/input, not business logic
  - [x] Ensure the App layer manages all conversation state and flow
  - [x] Establish clean separation of concerns between all layers

#### Priority 2: Core Functionality
- [x] Complete the critical compilation fixes
- [x] Attempt to compile and run the project
- [x] Fix compilation errors
- [x] Test basic functionality and fix any runtime issues
- [x] Test basic functionality including:
  - [x] Connecting to Claude API
  - [x] Sending/receiving messages
  - [x] Tool execution (bash, ls, view, etc.)
- [x] Enhance tool call handling in streaming responses
- [x] Improve error handling throughout the codebase
- [x] Add unit tests for core components

## Remaining Tasks

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Improve terminal-based chat interface (TUI)
- [x] Fix message display in TUI - prevent system messages from appearing in conversation

### Environment Management
- [x] CLAUDE.md memory file handling
- [x] .env file support for API key

### User Experience
- [ ] Improve input field with command history and editing
- [ ] Enhance Markdown rendering in terminal (Priority 1)
- [x] Add progress indicators for long-running operations (Priority 1)
- [ ] Implement clear visual distinction between user and assistant messages
- [ ] Add input history navigation
- [x] Add status indicators for processing state
- [x] Implement proper scrolling in the TUI (Priority 1)
- [x] Fix assistant response display issues (stuck on "Thinking...")
- [x] Fix message ordering in conversation display

### Configuration and Persistence
- [ ] Conversation history storage
- [ ] Project-specific settings

### API Client
- [x] Fix system message format (top-level parameter)
- [x] Improve streaming response handling
- [ ] Support different models (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok)
- [x] Fix system messages showing up in conversation UI

### Additional Features
- [ ] Add conversation saving and loading
- [ ] Implement command completion for the bash tool
